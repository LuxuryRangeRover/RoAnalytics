## 1. Understanding Overpays in Trading
When trading, there are two types of overpays to keep in mind: 
- **The overpay you give** - for example offering 300 overpay on a Legit  
- **The overpay you recieve** - for example, getting 600 overpay on a Legit

In an *ideal scenario*, you want to **give less overpay than you receive**. 
Because of this, overpay values can’t be represented by a single number/range; doing so would make it unclear whether that range applies to what you should give or what you should expect to receive.

## 2. RAP Items vs Proof-Based (Value) Items in Overpay Estimates
- RAP Items
  - *Most* RAP items are valued purely by their Recent Average Price (RAP), meaning **their worth is directly tied to how frequently and how well they sell** on the market.
- Proof-Based (Value) Items
  - Proof-based items, on the other hand, are valued based on completed trades, offers, and demand trends (including RAP too).
Because these two item types are valued differently, **their overpay estimates are also calculated differently**:
- RAP items rely more on **price behavior and sale trends**.
- Proof-based items depend on trading patterns and overpay **data**.
