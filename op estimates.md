# Overpay Estimates — RoAnalytics

_Last updated: October 12, 2025_

This document explains the **methodology used to calculate overpay (OP) estimates** in RoAnalytics. 
It provides insight into the data patterns, value relationships, and trade dynamics behind each estimate.

## 1. Understanding Overpays in Trading
When trading, there are two types of overpays to keep in mind: 
- **The overpay you give** - for example offering 300 overpay on a Legit  
- **The overpay you recieve** - for example, getting 600 overpay on a Legit

In an *ideal scenario*, you want to **give less overpay than you receive**, this difference is what creates your trading profit. 
Because of this, overpay values can’t be represented by a single number or range; doing so would make it unclear whether that range applies to what you should give or what you should expect to receive.

## 2. RAP Items vs Proof-Based (Value) Items in Overpay Estimates
Not all items are valued the same way — some depend on market sales, while others rely on trade evidence. Understanding this difference is key to interpreting overpay estimates correctly.
- RAP Items
  - *Most* RAP items are valued purely by their Recent Average Price (RAP), meaning **their worth is directly tied to how frequently and how well they sell** on the market.
  - These items tend to fluctuate more, since their value depends on sales activity rather than consistent trade history
- Proof-Based (Value) Items
  - Proof-based items, on the other hand, are valued based on completed trades, offers, and demand trends.
  - Their values are typically verified through proofs (screenshots of trades that show what the item was actually accepted for).
  - RAP can still play a role for high-demand items, but it’s only one of several factors influencing their overall value.
Because these two item types are valued differently, their overpay estimates are also calculated differently:
- RAP items rely more on **price behavior and sale trends**.
- Proof-based items depend on trading patterns and overpay **data**.
